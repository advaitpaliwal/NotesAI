Cluster 1
	I'm holding on to it
inside of the computer, and so now I see that this is a 1.
But not so much to play
around in a way that you might have if you did
use it in yesteryears, but to explore ideas of
computer science and programming that we're going to use and reuse
every week hereafter as well.
DAVID J. MALAN:
[CHUCKLES] All right, so-- [END PLAYBACK] [APPLAUSE] So this then is Scratch, a graphical
programming language from our friends down the road at MIT's Media
Lab that indeed some of you might have used in grade
school or the like, for playing and writing
code and the like, but you maybe didn't necessarily think
about how some of these primitives ultimately worked.
And in that sense,
computational thinking is just the application of ideas from
computer science, a course like this, to problems of interest to you, again,
in the arts, humanities, sciences, social sciences, whatever the
domain of interest is to you.
And there's other stuff too so
that the program knows how to start and how to stop, a lot
of stuff that we won't have to worry about, that whoever
designed the computer or the language did.
And so 9 times out of 10, so to
speak, it just crashes or freezes or the like, but that kind of
stuff will make more sense.
And so by human convention, let's just
assume that if you were a computer, be it a laptop, desktop,
phone, or the like, and you want to represent
the number 0, you know what, you just keep
the light switch off.
And so if you want to
represent the number you and I know as 1, like when
you type it on your keyboard, turns out the computer stores
that as the decimal number 49.
So abstraction is technically
a term that you'll see all over the place
in computer science, and really, problem
solving, that just refers to the simplification of something,
so that you don't focus on the lower level implementation details.
It turns out that, once you
paint yourself into this corner and start using 65
for A, 66 for B, well, how do you represent 65 the
number and 66 the number, if you want to do math or use
Excel or something like that?

Cluster 2
	And you won't have to deal with,
in this first week of class, is curly braces, parentheses,
all of the weird symbology that you might recall seeing, when we
just wanted to say, "Hello, world."
And if we look elsewhere-- let me
highlight the left of the chart-- you can see that next to 33 in decimal
is indeed the exclamation point.
Conversely, if you want to
represent the music that accompanies that or something else,
if any of you play an instrument and can read sheet music,
how could you digitize this?
So back in the day, a bunch
of humans got in a room, decided that, hey, when we start
building PCs and later Macs and phones, we all just have to agree on this
form of representation of letters of the English alphabet, in this case.
But this is the 1's place,
2's, 4's, 8s, 16, 32, 64, 128, and if I do all of that math from left
to right, that indeed gives me 255.
Using 8 bits, if we turn some of the
0's to 1's, let me just stipulate, you can represent the letter A using
8 bits, by turning certain ones on and certain ones off, but we will
try not to focus on that binary level too much.
But unary is a very
simple system of using a single symbol, a human finger in
this case, to just solve some problem, like counting the number
of people in the room.
And here, as I alluded
to verbally a moment ago, is the pattern of 0's and 1's
via which you'd represent 65.
How, though, if it's already using
those patterns of 0's and 1's apparently to represent
numbers from 0 on up, how do you go about representing letters
of the alphabet, might you think?
If I claim for the moment that ASCII
historically used 7 bits to represent letters-- and let's just
round that up to a byte-- 8 bits to represent letters, ASCII
can represent as many as 255, or really 256, total characters.

Cluster 3
	And here you have-- let me hide the trash
for just a moment-- is what I might call the second
version of my program, wherein, at the top right of the stage here,
I had the lamppost, which I just dragged and dropped and got going,
but then I added an actual sprite.
It's better designed just because
that's what you would kind of expect the software to do and not be some
kind of lame user interface that's just inserting random delays to just
make it kind of work, like that's a workaround, a hack, if you will.
I'm going to stop the
program and rerun it.
But if I keep doing stop and
start and stop and start, it's going to do the same
thing again and again.
Let me go ahead and just
hit Play on this Green Flag so you can see what the first building
block for this program might have been.
And in fact, everything you've done--
if you've used Scratch before-- and everything you'll see today is going
to apply to all of the weeks to come, as we explore these
things called "functions" and "loops" and "conditionals,"
"Boolean expressions" and more.
So once I do that, how do
I get to all of the others?
Else, so to speak, let's
just quit the program.
But this thing is indeed
a sprite because it needs to respond to code and
events, like dragging and dropping.
But notice, if I want the cat to meow a
second time, I'll just click it again.

Cluster 4
	So just as a corner case,
so to speak, something that you might trip over otherwise,
let me go ahead and under, let's see, Sensing, it turns out I also
need this for the piece of trash.
Let me go ahead and
throw all of this away.
Let me just grab something to put
these on, so I can use a few of them at a time.
Let me throw away all of this.
Let me go back to Looks.
Let me go back to some
random location at the top.
Let me go to Say.
Now I go down over here and let go.
Let me go ahead now
and do "hello" comma.
Let me go into my little
Extensions bucket over here.

Cluster 5
	I'm going to go ahead and
have a Control block that says If, because I want to implement
the idea of if the cursor is touching the cat, then play sound meow.
Conversely, if I want to
get rid of a puzzle piece, I can just drag it anywhere on the
left, let go, and that deletes it.
Well, if the cat is
touching the mouse pointer, I want to go ahead and
play sound meow until done.
Well, under Sensing, I'm
going to go ahead here and say If this trashcan is
Touching the Mouse Pointer-- what do I want to do?
And now-- and we heard a teaser
for this earlier in the crowd-- [MEOW] It's a little piercing, admittedly.
And let's get the cat to actually
meow, like a cat tends to.
So I'm going to drag it
higher up just so they're on the screen at the same time.
Let me kind of rewind a bit
and go to my Meow puzzle piece.
And let's get that cat to say
something actually on the screen.
It's forever listening
for the keyboard-- up, down, left, right-- and
feeling for the walls, in the sense that if I
get too far to the left, I don't want it to keep
moving past that black wall.

Cluster 6
	So where do we go with this?
Well, what's Yale going to do when I hit
the Green Flag now based on this code?
I'm going to go ahead and do this.
So let me do this.
So let me do this.
And let me do this.
So let me do this.
So let me do this.
So let me do this.
So let me do this.

Cluster 7
	A pixel is just a dot on the screen,
and if you really zoom in on it, you can literally see all of
the dots that compose an emoji, in this case on iOS, in the font
that Apple is using to represent this particular pattern of 0's and 0's.
So n over 2 means there's
half as many pages here, if n is the number of pages.
Well, if this I claim is
indeed how images are typically represented, using
pattern of bits that are assigned to some amount of red,
green, or blue, how do you get video?
So here is version 0, so to
speak, of this program, wherein the goal was to create a game where you
have to get out of some kind of maze.
What is a video, if at the end of
the day, all we have are 0's and 1's?
So there's probably some
math going on in there whereby the author of this program
just is incrementing, that is, adding 1 and 1 every time it detected
that a mole had been whacked, in this case, with movement.
Suppose that you want to change
the Wait to 2 seconds instead of 1.
Turns out, each of these are bytes, the
smallest value you can have in a byte we said is 0.
And now if I go to the top right of
the screen and click the Green Flag, we'll see, hopefully, my
very first program in code.
But in Photoshop or in
some graphical program, that same pattern would
be interpreted as let's call it a medium amount of
red, a medium amount of green, and a little bit of blue.

Cluster 8
	But at the end of the day,
these are fundamentally going to be the same
thing, which is to say that it's all pretty accessible to us.
So that you have now a mental model
for these types of blocks and others, let's return for a moment to this.
And now notice and recall,
when I had that same output become the input to my next block, it
looked a little something like this-- Say.
The output of one
function, Join, is going to be the input of
another function, Say.
When you program or write code and
you want the program or the computer to do something for you,
some action or verb, we're going to refer to
those actions or verbs as these things called
"functions," like those here.
Now, even if you lost track of
what I was turning on and why, I claim there were eight different
patterns, from all of them off to all of them on.
But let's now focus on this
Black box, so to speak, in the middle, this abstraction.
Let me go back to Scratch here and make
this maybe perhaps more interactive and actually get the cat to say
something a little more dynamically.
So you can imagine quantifying something
like music that in the real world is perfectly continuous as
something more discrete, by representing each note over time
as just some sequence of values.
But even humans themselves didn't
necessarily think two steps ahead, and now a lot of the emoji
are the default yellow color.

Cluster 9
	But then there's this white oval and
some text that, by default, is "hello" because MIT just decided that,
by default, the placeholder will be "hello."
Over here to the left, of
course, would be -240 and 0.
And it seems that by moving
up, down, left, or right, this little crest on the screen
responds in exactly that way.
The clock on your
phone, that's in a loop forever because you want it
to always tell time and not stop at the end of the day.
And now notice, at the top left of my
program, notice the score is now 2.
Above the cat would be
x equals 0, because it's right on that vertical midline, and 180.
If you think back to that coordinate
system, 0,0 is in the middle.
So 10 is the default.
Notice that my hand here is actually
on the Arrow keys on my keyboard.
So-- whoops-- let's do 0,240
so that this piece of trash always starts at the top
middle of the screen.

Cluster 10
	Yeah-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, what if John
Harvard isn't in the phone book?
AUDIENCE: OK. DAVID J. MALAN: So line your
head up in the box in a moment.
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] DAVID J. MALAN: Say it again.
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] DAVID J. MALAN: Oh, good question.
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] DAVID J. MALAN: I heard it here.
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] DAVID J. MALAN: OK. DAVID J. MALAN: OK. DAVID J. MALAN: OK.
Oh, I-- DAVID J. MALAN: It's
pretty easy at first but-- OSCAR THE GROUCH: (SINGING)
--anything dirty or dingy-- DAVID J. MALAN: So I don't
need to keep playing this up on stage in front of everyone.
[MUSIC PLAYING] DAVID J. MALAN: All right.
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah.
DAVID J. MALAN: Just
one more step, right?

Cluster 11
	I'm going to do the Speak block here,
in green, and let it snap into place.
And the Green Flag is going to
mean go and the red Stop Sign is going to mean stop, to
start or stop our program.
When I, the human, clicked
on that Green Flag, I triggered, what we're going to
start calling now, an "event."
So if I go ahead and zoom in on
this and click the Green Flag, I can still move up and down.
And I'm going to drag and
drop this first block, called when Green Flag clicked.
Let me make sure that
the very first thing I do when the Green Flag is clicked,
is always start with the trashcan closed because otherwise, you
might accidentally leave it open.
If I click and drag
on it-- here it goes-- and I let go, it looks like
it's going into the trash can because it snaps back up
to some random location.
And here we have a Green Flag.
And now let me click the Green Flag.
Let me go ahead now and
click the Green Flag.

Cluster 12
	But there's, down the road,
a history of an MIT hack, and it looked a little something
like this, in yesteryear.
And indeed, this particular
path led me to computer science, but the hope for CS50 more
generally is that, indeed, you just find your way to
applying principles that you'll learn over the
coming months to whatever field is of interest to you.
Later in the semester, once
you tackle your final projects, the capstone of the course, where we
don't give you a homework to write, you yourself come up
with something to build.
And it's really not that
interesting, at the end of the day, maybe gratifying once, but it'd be nice
if this were a little more interactive.
But you can change Scratch's costume so
that it looks like a singer or the man falling from the sky or
the like or anything else, either creating the art yourself or
importing some of the things that come with it or elsewhere online.
If you go up here to Costumes, this is
where all the graphical stuff happens.
And so in particular, here,
this is the very first web app that I myself made back in like 1997.
Well, here's an old school
incarnation of this, and odds are, you might not have
had occasion to even physically use this thing, nowadays.
But it wasn't until
sophomore year that I got up the nerve to step foot
in the CS50 classroom, and even then, it was
only out of curiosity.
And finally, we'll tie
all of this together by introducing what are called
frameworks and libraries, third-party code that makes it a lot
easier to solve problems of interest to you.

Cluster 13
	Yeah, over here.
Here we go, D-A-V-I-D. And this one's kind of cool.
[APPLAUSE] All right, so here we have-- come on down.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Cluster 14
	Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Welcome.

Cluster 15
	So just keep in mind,
that's very much the intent, but you'll be amazed what you're
able to create, to accomplish, just three or so months hence.
And as you'll see in the coming
weeks, as you write your own code and solve your own problems, what
ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end
up relative to your classmates but where you end up relative
to yourself when you began.
And I'm just going to go
ahead and quickly click OK. That just gives me a very
generic, pink puzzle piece that starts with the word
Define because scratch is asking me to define, that
is, implement or create, this new puzzle piece for me.
And the program I wrote all
those years ago and still rather cling to is a
little something here called Oscartime, that I thought I'd
play just a quick excerpt of myself here.
This is going to
represent what we're going to start calling a "conditional,"
a proverbial fork in the road where you can either go this way or that
way, do this thing or this other thing.
But you'll find that
the ideas, in fact, are going to be more familiar than
you might otherwise think.
My input for that second version of,
"Hello, world," was to now pass in, for instance, "What's Your Name?"
The input to the current problem
is going to be in white here, "Hello, world."
We'll empower you, ultimately, to write
code after CS50, especially if this is the only CS class you ever
take, on your own Mac or PC, using the same software, but not
the cloud-based version thereof.
It too is evolving, and
the languages you're about to learn in the coming days,
those too are evolving as well.

Cluster 16
	And let me go ahead and open up the
final version of these building blocks that adds MIT to the mix.
So what are we going to
do in the coming weeks?
And we won't really go
down the rabbit hole of all of the fun and
family-friendly features that it has.
And so I think, for this, we
need perhaps one final volunteer.
It's going to be some
color of the rainbow.
And let me propose what's
going to happen here.
And some of you might recognize
this environment here, a.k.a.
So let's go ahead and play
this one in full screen.
And we humans are just kind of
assuming, oh, it's opening up.
So we need some final flourishes.

Cluster 17
	And there's more going on,
but we'll take a quick glance what's actually going on.
So here's what we're about to see.
And I'm going to edit it.
Well, you can perhaps see
a spoiler on the screen.
But now I can throw, unnecessarily
dramatically, half and page one out of the way, and what do I now know?
But so much of it, ultimately,
is going to be absorbed by you and going to be within
your grasp by terms end.
So anything related to what
the cat looks like it's doing is actually going to be
under looks, here in purple.
And honestly, there are so many
different puzzle pieces in here.
So let me zoom in here and type
in "hello," maybe comma, space.
Let me go ahead and see
inside version 1 our second.

Cluster 18
	So let's go a little more fishing here.
I'm going to go ahead now and
temporarily move this over here.
Let me maybe Say here.
Let me drag this away here.
So let me go ahead and drag this thing
over here, ask, "What's your name?"
Now, there's a lot of options here.
There's a lot of stuff in here.
And now let me go ahead and zoom out.
How should you cooperate here?
Now, let me go ahead and click Play.

Cluster 19
	Let me refactor this, so
to speak, that is, rip out the code that seems to be
repeated again and again and put it in its own function so
you can give it a descriptive name and use and reuse it.
The fact that I've indented line 5
implies, by convention in programming, that I should only do line 5 if the
answer to line 4 is a yes or a true, and same for these other
indented lines as well.
If I let go, in some kind
of loop, Oscar pops out, creates a variable
with the current score.
You're not going to get stuck
in a so-called infinite loop so long as you keep dividing the
problem and shrinking it into something smaller, smaller, smaller.
And even though there's not
a loop in this pink function, there is where I'm using it.
Almost all of the file extensions
you see on your Mac or PC, if you see them at all,
ultimately just mean there's a different form of
representation for, in this case, something like sound.
This will be the so-called
"return value" of that function.
The function, in this case,
is that new block called Join.
I'm going to claim that it means to do
these two steps, to play the sound meow and then just wait for 1 second.
Step 3 is look at the page,
thereby repeating the same process again and again.

Cluster 20
	Yeah-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] DAVID J. MALAN: How did I make
it so it meows three times?
DAVID J. MALAN: OK. You can't.
Throw this half away, and
now I'm really flying.
Let them know that you're too much
and this a beat, uh, they can't touch.
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch.
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Josh.
You can't touch this.
you can't touch this.
You can't touch this.
You can't touch this.

Cluster 21
	So I could hide it.
The goal is to solve it.
And so Scratch will be
smart about it and grow to fill that puzzle piece for you.
So how can we do this?
And this is where Andrew, and
soon you, will drag and drop some of those puzzle pieces
and other colors as well and lock them together to
get your character-- soon to be invented-- to do
something on the screen.
So how might we do this?
And notice, that any time there's
multiple people with a name that starts with H, like Hermione,
Harry, and Hagrid, well, they can't all fit in that mailbox, if
each of these squares along the left is that same mailbox.
We send text messages, write
documents, emails, and the like.
But we can change that.
I don't want to just type in my
own name because, again, then what's the point of asking
the user for their name?

Cluster 22
	If you've ever gotten like an
icon on your phone that's broken, and you've been sent an emoji, but it's
like a square or something arbitrary and not sensible, it might
just mean that you have not updated to the latest
version of iOS or Android, which just updates the
font of supported emoji.
And indeed, this is just
one key press on your phone, and you can combine different emoji
on the left and then the right with the emoji in the middle.
It's a markup language, and some
of you might have made home pages or portfolios in the past.
So there too, after just three
months of a class like this, you'll go from writing
quite simply this week and next Hello, World
to building things like this for whether it's web,
mobile, or other platforms as well, if you so choose.
If it's supported by the
company and by Unicode, you can actually touch and
hold on a certain emoji, and then you can choose
the appropriate skin tone to represent yourself or someone else.
And it has to be a sprite if you
want it to do things interactively.
Indeed, at the bottom right
here, will you see, ultimately, a sprite area, where a
sprite is a technical term for like a character in a video game
or a programming environment like this.
But there's a lot of emoji that
aren't these cartoon characters, but they're meant to represent
humans in various professions or gestures or the like.
Well, let's just think
for a moment here, how did Apple and Google
and Microsoft and others go about implementing support for
emoji with different skin tones?
I only knew C and maybe a little
bit of something else at the time.

Cluster 23
	And notice that the
shape of this Green Flag just so happens to mirror
this Green Flag here at top, next to this
red Stop Sign, of sorts.
Well, it turns out that,
as of this past year, this is the most popular emoji
to be sent by many measures, Face with Tears of Joy.
So this is apparently
the name of the costume that this student made,
Harvard logo outline.
M-E-O-W will be the name of this block.
And so the side effect
here is that the cat has this speech bubble magically appear,
inside of which is "Hello, world."
It looks like this.
This icon, if you have an iPhone, is,
of course for your contacts application.
It would be weird if you
do, but what is this?
So there's a little bit of room in there
for some of those more playful things, like those emoji.
And if I keep scrolling down, there's
this Join "apple" and "banana."

Cluster 24
	I don't have to change it in
multiple places and not screw up.
And let me go under the Sounds block.
And then let me go back to Sensing.
And if I want it to look prettier, I
could just have many other costumes and go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
to create more frames per second, if you will.
Let me grab that same answer because
I threw it away a second ago, and I'll just change it.
So let me detach this temporarily.
5 seconds.
12 seconds.
But I didn't sit down and implement
Oscartime, as I called it, all at once.
The higher you go up on the y-axis, the
more time you're taking to solve it.

Cluster 25
	You take this vision you
might have or some vision you've been assigned in
a homework assignment and try to break it down
into these constituent parts and just pluck off the easy ones first.
If you want to represent some
smiling emoji but in five, in this case, different skin
tones, you could come up with what?
What do you not see in this chart?
So just based on what
you've seen already or if you've program before,
which a few of you have, what's the term of art
here that will solve this?
Well, here's where you start
to poke around and think about how you might solve this.
For each of these possible
variants, you have a representation of just the emoji itself,
structurally, and then reusable patterns for
those five skin tones.
You don't have five completely
distinct patterns, per se.
And this is only to
say-- no pun intended-- that almost everything that you
do with these puzzle pieces, be it in the context of
Oscartime or the mole whacking or even just something
simple like, "Hello, world," will ultimately fit into that
relatively simple mental model there.
Five different patterns that
are identical, structurally, except for the skin tone
used in places in that image.
Even though you and I look at these
things and they look like images, they're not images.

Cluster 26
	Notice the score, if I do this
again, is about to become 3.
The left most is 2 to the 2, a.k.a.
But it is the second sprite.
And I'm going to change it for
now, just to be 3, for consistency.
I click there, I change it to 2.
One is a 4, but each of you
is still just has a switch on the bottom, in fact,
of your plastic devices.
And so this will be the actual version
but written by one of your predecessors that I'll full screen here.
And if you picture
here, this is actually a pretty representative problem.
And I'm going to say
x, how about, will be-- let's not hardcode this.
Fine, I click there, I change it to 2.

Cluster 27
	And you can click and zoom
in to make it full screen.
And I've zoomed in there just to
make it a little more legible.
You've got a whole bunch of
memory, like the picture before, but you can think of it really
as individual mailboxes.
To you, it's just a way
of getting from point A to point B.
Let me go to Text to Speech.
I don't even have to delete "hello."
Because now it really
just says what it means.
It just says what it means.
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, or
equivalently, a sequence of images that, over time,
are changing on the screen.
And then I clicked on
Add a Label over here.

Cluster 28
	DAVID J. MALAN: Notice he is
using the up, down, left, right.
Yeah, that's how it look when
you know you can't touch this.
Enter.
Enter.
Enter.
Enter.
Enter.
I just want, "hello," comma.
A little hard to do
physically, especially since no one's used this phone
book in a lot of years.
Notice the little text box below
the cat is asking, what's your name?

Cluster 29
	But let's change it to
"hello" and my name.
It's just, you and I, in
the room, are just way too slow to notice that it
said-- (QUICKLY) "Hello, David."
Like, I wanted to say, "Hello,
David," not just "David."
I wanted him to say,
"hello," not just my name.
Well, maybe the first
version would have been something like this, whereby my
very first version of Oscartime might have said
something like, oh, this.
OK, I don't want to say, "Hello, hello."
So instead of "Hello,
world," why don't we get him to say hello to me
or to you or anyone else?
So that's all fine and
good, "Hello, world."
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] DAVID J. MALAN: It will indeed say,
rather disappointingly, apparently, just, "Hello, world."
It says, of course, "Say" in purple.

Cluster 30
	So the cat is still in that world.
But the cat does not want
to be pet, in this case.
Under Sensing, which I know is
there because I've done this before, are a whole bunch of things related
to Sensing, whereby the cat can kind of feel out its world, in some sense.
I'm just turning on
the one in the middle.
Let me drag the same
oval as before, clobber-- that is, overwrite-- banana.
The cat's out of the bag.
Now, how do I make the trash move?
I can sort of drag it out of the way.
So you're not confined to just one cat.
Well, let's make this an actual cat that
doesn't talk in that weird human voice.

Cluster 31
	It's really easy down
the spine that way, but I know that John
Harvard is to the left here.
And you have to get out, in this case,
the Harvard crest from this maze.
Will I find John
Harvard, if he's in here?
But then it forever points to Harvard.
So if I don't consider that, and I find
myself in like the I section or the J section, well, I might
accidentally conclude, nope, I haven't found John Harvard yet,
just because I skipped him, because it was sandwiched between two pages.
Is John Harvard to my
left or to my right?
But this became, for Harvard at
least, the very first website for the first-year
intramural sports program, and it wasn't just a static website
with links and images and the like.
But what do I now know
about John Harvard?
But now Yale's in the mix,
bouncing back and forth.
So here is MIT.

Cluster 32
	and I'm a first year.
And in fact, pictured here are some
of your predecessors in healthy times.
But Yale is just kind of doing
this all day long, back and forth and back and forth, forever.
My name is David Malan, and I actually
took this course myself, back in 1996.
I was a sophomore at the time.
On the wall it says, getting
an education from MIT is like drinking from a
fire hose, which indeed they have connected to what should have
been otherwise just a water fountain.
But first, we have three Yales.
If you're not from STEM, if
you're not from CS, that's fine.
I'm a senior.
These ones, too, made by
some of your predecessors.

Cluster 33
	Again-- now it's back to the right.
Now it's a little more to the left.
I want an If, but I just don't want
one question, I really want two, a fork in the road that goes
left or right, so to speak.
So alphabetically, he's
presumably to my left, and so here I can, both
metaphorically and physically, tear the problem in half.
I took into account which ones
were on and which ones were off.
They're just all off.
And that's the key about going to
the left half or the right half.
Where is he, to my left or to my right?
So it's neither up or below.
If Touching the Left Wall Or-- notice the green block-- Touching the Right Wall, then
just Turn around 180 Degrees.

Cluster 34
	So it looks like interactivity,
but you are really just changing the aesthetics.
But nowadays, as you
might have seen, you can have couples in
love for instance that actually look a little more like three
emojis, but just kind of combined into one.
But if it's immediately followed
by a certain pattern of bits that these humans
standardize to represent each of these different shades of
skin tone, then the phone, the Mac, the PC will change that default
color, yellow in most cases, to whatever the more apt human tone is.
But what most of us would
do, and what your phones are doing, albeit
digitally, is they open up roughly to the middle of the phonebook.
But this puzzle piece
is a little different.
Those three colors, like wavelengths
of light, are combined in such a way that you would have this dot on
the screen, a sort of murky shade of yellow or brown.
But you'll notice, many of you
might have iPhones, some of you might have Android devices
too, and sometimes, these don't actually look quite the same.
That makes things look
a little more smooth.
Well, they just use a different base.

Cluster 35
	And let's use that as a term of art.
Well, let's generalize this.
So let's just deal with those first.
How about Events-- or rather-- yes, Events.
We'll use metaphors along
the way, if it helps.
How can we take this high-level
idea, put trash into the trash can, and make it seem to disappear?
And I'm going to introduce
another vocabulary term.
And so here I'm borrowing
terminology from before.
Now, let's call out a few
of these salient terms.

Cluster 36
	If I go back to the sensing block,
this is where that oval that's blue, called Answer, is useful.
But for now, I'm going to focus on
this, this blue puzzle piece that asks a question, which itself is
this white oval that I can apparently change, and then it's going
to wait for a response.
And that's just so that I can ask
questions of these other two sprites.
Notice that n here is its own
oval I can drag a copy of n and just let it go there.
And you'll notice too, that when it
gets to be sort of brownish here, the dots really stand out.
How much red green blue for this dot?
How much red green blue for this dot?
How much red, green, blue for this dot?
And in fact, let me just
draw some dotted lines here.

Cluster 37
	So that even if you get
more data than you expect, if your business is booming, and
you're some web-based business, how do you keep adding
and adding information to your software to
actually keep up with it?
So what do I know?
And let me do Video Sensing, since
most laptops or phones these days have cameras.
We could input exactly who was in
a tournament bracket or the like, and it could actually automatically
keep track of this data.
You and I trigger events
on our phones all day long.
And you can put anything
you want in those mailboxes, and you can go to a mailbox to
grab information that's from it.
So this gets me into some default state.
So I'm taking into account
some time apparently.
My first step, really, was
picking up the phone book.

Cluster 38
	And it happens again.
But I'm going to throw that away
and focus only now on the sounds.
And I clicked Edit.
And it did.
And I'll use the default question.
That's not what I want.
Feel free to get up or stay here.
These are all of my English verbs.
Let me zoom out again.

Cluster 39
	I'm literally going to be grabbing the
trash from the same place every time.
OK, I kind of want it to
go into the trash can.
Well, if I wanted to introduce something
like the trash, I need a second sprite.
Well, I want to change what
the trashcan looks like.
Maybe grab the biggest elements,
put them over on the right.
And indeed, if you think
this through logically, that just means you're
bouncing this way and this way by just flipping yourself around 180
degrees for just this Yale sprite.
You drag this purple puzzle piece.
As soon as you start dragging on
a block, if it gets close to it, it kind of goes gray, and it can
be magnetically snapped together.
So I'm skipping every other page.

Cluster 40
	So it's not actual motion
picture, if you will.
So what does this mean in real terms?
DAVID J. MALAN: OK, so Hertz
value, so some frequency.
So I called this one Score.
It points in direction 90 degrees.
240 is straight above it.
When Video Motion is
Greater Than some value.
And that's what makes it sound low
or high or somewhere in between.
It's going up, down, up, down.

Cluster 41
	It's a little special.
You don't need to be impressed.
I've grabbed a little electricity.
[LAUGHS] [APPLAUSE] Congrats.
[APPLAUSE] Yo, sound the bell.
[APPLAUSE] All right.
Round of applause.
[APPLAUSE] All right.
Maybe a round of applause for
our first volunteers of term.

Cluster 42
	And honestly, it would be nice if it
doesn't always start from the top.
It's just changing the costume
that's being overlaid on the sprite.
It's just an image a costume,
if you will, for the whole stage itself, a backdrop.
And so here we see, by
default, just one sprite selected because on the top right of
the screen is the stage for that sprite.
And I don't want the whole thing, sorry.
I added a costume for it.
Well, no, it's just changing a costume.
And you'll notice something curious
and different about this purple block.
Because if you add one
more page next year because more people move
to Cambridge, you're going to add one more
page turn potentially, so one more second, one more unit of time.

Cluster 43
	Yeah-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, it's chasing
down the Harvard logo outline.
DAVID J. MALAN: Hi.
And they look down, and they say,
oh, I'm in roughly the M section.
Yes, hi is the message, but 72,
73 gives us H and I.
DAVID J. MALAN: Hey!
DAVID J. MALAN: If you
want to say it into there.
Welcome, Josh.
You'll see the English message
that your friend intended.
I'm Ellie.

Cluster 44
	So my score is already
now up to some 6 or so.
OK, so 50 was too big of a number.
Why don't we keep track
now of the user score?
So I'm going to choose 50,
somewhat arbitrarily here-- so 50.
OK, 8, and now lastly, give me 15.
So here we are in week zero.
And eventually, you need toes and
whatnots, if you have to count so high.
Now, the only thing I'm not doing really
is keeping track of any kind of score.

Cluster 45
	It's going to stitch together all
of these same primitives and more, but add the notion of scores and
lives so that there's actually a goal, which in this case is to move
the Harvard crest to constantly pursue the character on the right-hand side
so that your sprite touches that one.
That means put the Harvard crest dead
center in the middle of the stage.
So again, y is the vertical.
But it is the right shape.
So it's kind of like bouncing
off ever so slightly so that it doesn't slip through that actual wall.
So no matter where I'm
moving it, up, down, left, or right, MIT is being a little
more strategic than Yale, bouncing back and forth like this.
And notice that the
green line is going up and up and up but a much slower rate
of increase, which means crazy things are possible.
If you just hover in between blocks,
it will grow to fill that too.

Cluster 46
	But this song is synchronized then with
a lot of the actions that's happening.
Forever-- so I want the lid
to open up if I touch it.
Under the same orange Control
category is a Repeat block.
Now, thankfully, the
paradox stops there.
And I can never listen
to the song again, not that I should be anyway
at this point in my life.
MC HAMMER: (SINGING) Catch
this beat while it's rolling.
Why do I not constantly keep
looking for John Harvard forever by nature of these loops
telling me to keep going back to line 3?
So sound is some frequency, and
it's kind of hitting your eardrum.

Cluster 47
	You'll have to stand
in front of the camera.
Go to the half of this, and so this
time, I went back a little too far.
Now, you know you want to dance.
And here, in advance, I
grabbed the image already.
Out of sight, out of mind.
So notice this shape here, way too big.
Yo, I told you.
Now, what does that mean?

Cluster 48
	All right, so still,
nothing bad happens.
So I'd wager this is correct.
So so glad to have all
three of you up here.
All right, that was pretty fast.
Thank you all.
It is correct.
Is this correct?
Right?

Cluster 49
	Like what is with that?
And the last characteristic
here is this here.
Why is that?
But it's indeed conditional.
But it's everywhere, nonetheless.
How would you know that?
What does this mean?
Like, that's just stupid.

Cluster 50
	And then any time my
piece of trash is touching Oscar, let's not just jump to the top,
let's change the score by 1 up here.
So now-- OSCAR THE GROUCH: (SINGING) I have
here some newspaper, 13 months old.
OSCAR THE GROUCH: (SINGING)
It's awful, the holes.
[MUSIC - OSCAR THE GROUCH, "I LOVE
 TRASH"] OSCAR THE GROUCH:
(SINGING) Oh, I love trash.
Oscar2 is open.
Oscar1 is closed.
I'm going to change it
not to Oscar8, but Oscar2.
Well, some of these costumes
are called like Oscar1, Oscar2.

Cluster 51
	And it'll eventually sink in, but not
to worry if the terminology doesn't come naturally early on.
So I'm going to drag over Say "hello."
Well, this won't be Scratch.
It's fine for English, but
not a lot of human languages.
Well, base terminology is
now a little more germane.
I use C, generally,
September, October, November, December, when teaching CS50 itself.
We'll talk about problems
that arise even nowadays.

Cluster 52
	And let me propose that here, instead
of having just one light bulb, let me give myself maybe three in total.
Well, there were probably
at least four sprites.
But it's more correct.
What's 33?
So here we go, three meows.
And then I should go back to step three.
You just turn on the third light bulb.

Cluster 53
	You can think of them
metaphorically as light bulbs, but they don't actually shine light.
Ah, so that's why my two light
bulbs went on at the end.
Well, I'm just considering the
combination of bulbs being on here.
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah,
so more light bulbs.
Well, let me go ahead and propose that
I just grab one of our own light bulbs here on stage.
But for me, the light bulb went off.
If you're a graphic designer,
you might know them, but RGB is still pretty common.

Cluster 54
	Or honestly, if the game is
going to be ongoing, like it was, letting me drop more and
more trash, let me just have it go ahead and pick
a new random location.
What more can I now do?
Then pluck off something
like the trash can, and just make it do a little thing.
It doesn't matter if you do
the same thing again and again.
Stop.
And let me grab this puzzle
piece here, as I did long ago.
So now notice what happens.

Cluster 55
	I didn't delete it--
drag it out of the way.
In just a moment, you're going to
have to position your head in a box that your classmate
from yesteryear created.
So I'm just going to
put a placeholder there.
And it's going to have placeholder here.
Yeah-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] DAVID J. MALAN: OK, so when it
touches it, let's have it disappear.
DAVID J. MALAN: Oh, actually,
say it into the microphone.
Whenever you tap or drag
or long press or pinch or any of those gestures in
vogue nowadays on phones, you are triggering events.

Cluster 56
	DAVID J. MALAN: So pixels,
it's getting very pixelated.
You can create more and more
sprites, change what they look like.
This happens to be the current version
of Face with Tears of Joy on iOS.
AUDIENCE: Pixels.
So not quite RGB.
AUDIENCE: RGB.
Similarly, if it's touching the right
wall, I want to back it up one pixel so it's no longer touching that wall.

Cluster 57
	But I'm going to get rid of
the Say block, in purple.
How do I make it go into the trash can?
And if it moves too far to the right, I
don't want it to blow through that wall either.
Now it's a little to the left.
You're kind of blowing
through it already.
But it's not the best design.
So how do we get there?

Cluster 58
	MC HAMMER: (SINGING)
You can't touch this.
[APPLAUSE] MC HAMMER: (SINGING) I told you,
homeboy, you can't touch this.
You just take a really big
bite out of the problem once you decide if John Harvard
is to the left or to the right.
Look at my eyes, man,
you can't touch this.
and do you want to confirm or
deny, the hand that went up here?
[MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC - MC HAMMER, "U CAN'T TOUCH
 THIS"] MC HAMMER: (SINGING) You can't this.
And how do I bite off maybe
the easiest parts first?

Cluster 59
	So now notice, If Touching Oscar,
Change the Score-- that is, Add 1 to the Score-- and then Pick a new Random location.
My third step was somewhat different--
look at the page, because why?
Now, I can fix this, I think,
if I do hit the I section, well, let me just double back one page,
just in case he was in that last page.
But I'm going to go to
events, in yellow, first.
But notice that I
started to permute them.
RGB was called out
earlier, Red, Green, Blue.
Anyone recall what message
you might have received from the green and white charts?

Cluster 60
	But that's a little inefficient to just
do copy, paste, paste, paste, paste, and change the color in
Photoshop, if you will.
So how do I want to do this in my Score?
What I thing I want to do is this.
How do I want to do this?
Now, here's an interface by which
I can give the block a name.
And I'm going to drag a Repeat block
over here and let that snap into place.

Cluster 61
	DAVID J. MALAN: Come on over
right to the right of here, and you'll be number 4, it turns out.
How about do you want to be number 2?
And now I can do it again, 125.
You can't just wave your hand,
and say, oh, figure it out.
Any guesses to 33?
So we would have on,
off, off, which I think matches what I did with
my three light bulbs as well, if you want to
go and turn yours off.

Cluster 62
	They don't have access to 10 different
types of electricity, just 2, on or off, if you will.
Well, it turns on one
of these light bulbs.
So for instance, if this were
miniaturized inside of your Mac, PC, or phone, this would be a
transistor, and indeed, here's the little switch on the bottom.
Instead of just considering
there to be light bulbs, let's assign some special significance
to each of them, based on where it is.
Well, at the end of the day, you and
I are charging our laptops or phones at night.
You keep a light bulb off.

Cluster 63
	Just like we had a 4th volunteer
come on up to give us a 4th bid, let's just throw hardware at the
problem and use a few more bits.
Time to solve the problem.
And you'll see, in the remainder
of class here, a couple of others as well, and more in the course's first
assignment, namely, problem set zero.
And then, oh my God, the rush
of emotion of accomplishment of pride of exhaustion when you
finally solve some problem that's really been weighing on you.
But the third algorithm, that I ended
with, tearing things again and again, dividing and conquering, if you will,
in half and in half and in half, how many more steps
will my third algorithm take if Cambridge and Allston merge
into a phone book that's twice as big?
Eventually, there's going to
be no problem left to solve.

Cluster 64
	And so this, in essence, is
what your computer, your phone is probably doing underneath the hood
when searching for Harry or Hermione or Hagrid or anyone else
because it's that much faster, especially when you have large data.
It's sequences of pictures,
and your brain and mind are interpolating that, oh, this is
smooth movement, even though we're just seeing a lot of pictures really fast.
That really means you're seeing 24
images per second, or on TV or in soap operas, it's often 30 frames per second.
In fact, most of you are
familiar with your Mac, PC, even phone like spontaneously
rebooting sometimes, crashing, the little annoying spinning beach
ball or hourglass icon that happens.
You and I hear them when
we play files, but what's really going on underneath the hood?
Probably not small
numbers of bytes, probably kilobytes for thousands of bytes,
megabytes for millions of bytes, gigabytes for billions of
bytes, especially for video.

Cluster 65
	Alternatively, you can Right-click
or Control-click a puzzle piece and just duplicate it from a
little menu that drops down.
These puzzle pieces, a.k.a.
So here's another puzzle
piece called Change y.
We haven't seen this puzzle piece yet.
It only was a matter of dragging
and dropping puzzle pieces.
And in just a moment,
we'll see something they called Ivy's Hardest Game, focused
here on these particular mechanics.

Cluster 66
	But they generally
just do what they say.
I'm doing it verbally slowly, but
that went from 1,000 pages to 500 to now 250.
Well, how about two pages at a time?
But this is all you can find, and at
that, it's even hard to find this.
AUDIENCE: A filter?
So it's absolutely not the case that
the person to the left or the right surely must know more than you.

Cluster 67
	So how is that happening?
We kind of have to pick a lane,
but there's a solution to that too that we'll see.
Like how would you teach someone younger
than you, who's never done that before, how to do it?
How can we fix this?
And for instance, if the
problem at hand quite simply is to take attendance
at the beginning of class, on the first day of school, well,
how could we go about doing this?
You'll use a cloud based
version of it initially, so you don't have to suffer
with any technical difficulties or headaches like that.

Cluster 68
	Eventually, he'll be on the page or, to
your point earlier, he won't be at all and we're out of pages,
and so we just quit.
If two towns in Massachusetts,
like Cambridge and Allston, across the river, merge next year, for
instance, in terms of their phone book, they're phone book
just got twice as big.
My fourth step was if person I'm looking
for is on the page, I then do what?
At some point, I will find him, and if
he's on the page, I'll be able to call.
I've gone from 1,000 pages to like 500.
So how might we go about searching
for someone in a phonebook like this, like say John Harvard?

Cluster 69
	Making them sweat, that's
what I'm giving them.
And these green ones do
exactly what they say.
Humidity is rising.
Pump a little bit, and let them know
what's going on, like that, like that.
I'm going to let myself
get absolutely soaking wet!
And leave those umbrellas at home.

Cluster 70
	MIT is coming soon.
But what has now happened?
For the Googles of the world,
that's going to get really slow.
You really just focus on the high
level goals or the process itself.
But we'll get you off of the course's
infrastructure, by the end of the term.

Cluster 71
	I'm going to drag and drop
this inside of the If.
Let me go ahead and open
up in another editor here an early incarnation of
Oscartime by doing this.
Let me go ahead and grab a program
I opened in advance here called Whack-A-Mole Might we get a
brave volunteer to come up, who is willing to whack a mole
with their head, virtually?
That seems a reasonable place to start.
This algorithm, is this correct?

Cluster 72
	How about feeling for walls?
So if you hit the wall, it's too late.
How about, Whenever the Trash is-- how about-- Touching the Trash Can-- so Forever If-- let's see,
I need a Sensing block.
And what are those walls?
Let them magnetically lock
together, so to speak.

Cluster 73
	All right, that's it for CS50.
The CS50 fair allows you to
come with your laptop or phone and exhibits of students,
faculty, and staff across campus put together something
in person and on video that people can delight in seeing,
as you exhibit what it is you created and what you learned over the
course of the several weeks.
After this, cake awaits
for everyone outside, as is an end of first
lecture CS50 tradition.
And you'll all walk home,
ultimately, with your own I took CS50 T-shirts saying as much as well.
If you want to leave
your numbers over here, we have a CS50 stress ball for you,
but thank you for volunteering.

Cluster 74
	Well, typically, you could just start
at the top and look to the bottom, searching for all of the H's or all
of the H-A's, but for larger data sets that's going to get slow.
D-A-V-I-D. D-A-V-I-D.
I'm in now the E section.
So I have to search for John Harvard
from left to right, searching for H, if it's alphabetized by last name.

Cluster 75
	I want this to say, "Hello"
comma name, where name comes from that Answer return value.
That's when you call it a day, take
a break, move onto something else, and then just come back to it.
AUDIENCE: My name is [?
AUDIENCE: My name is [?
What's the question I want to ask?

Cluster 76
	I was actually concentrating in
government, because a year prior, as a first year, I'd come
into Harvard thinking that I liked history and constitutional
law and similar classes in high school.
I really did take baby
steps, so to speak.
And you couldn't necessarily
be one gender or another, in a certain profession or another.
I figured, if I liked and if I were
good at that particular subject in high school, then that's presumably
who I'm supposed to be here.
With that said, it was
definitely a lot of work and not without its frustrations for me.

Cluster 77
	[PROJECTOR CLICKING] [MUSIC PLAYING]
Singers are sweating, so pass
them a wipe or a tape to learn.
Give me a song, a rhythm.
Let me go into Oscartime here.
You better listen.

Cluster 78
	So let's see what happens now that
they're kind of stacked on top of each other or nested, so to speak.
The lamppost-- not a sprite.
What's a video, perhaps?
So how does this type of block and
this nesting, this stacking of blocks, fit into the same mental model?
So there are some stairs on either end.

Cluster 79
	Indeed, it's quite the opposite.
Well, it turns out that
two things have happened.
Someone called this
out earlier, in fact.
But now it's struggling, right?
Does anyone see the solution, perhaps?

Cluster 80
	Step 9, though, might be else if
the person is later in the book, then let's go ahead and open to the
middle of the right half of the book and then go back to line 3.
Well, it's going to be a straight line.
But is this algorithm correct, turning
page by page, very inelegantly?
If you don't have that
many contacts, it probably doesn't matter if you search
from top to bottom or more in the form of this
divide-and-conquer algorithm.
Because you're going to
run up against a wall.

Cluster 81
	So how about, when the user
actually drags the piece of trash to the trash can, let me
go under Variables here, where, in advance, I've already
made myself a variable called Score.
DAVID J. MALAN: OK, so some trash is
moving, presumably in some kind of loop from the top.
I named it trash.
I love it because it's trash.
The trashcan opens.

Cluster 82
	Green Flag, what's your name?
Moin.
Moin.
What's your name?
Rayhanna, ?]

Cluster 83
	Even though it's not the right
size, it is the right shape.
So this, too, wrong
size but right shape.
Yeah, in the middle?
If you want to go over
to the stage there.
But there's only one oval.

Cluster 84
	Now they know, you
talk about the Hammer, you talking about a show
that's hyped and tight.
Hmm, rising.
AUDIENCE: Hertz value?
Is that everyone-- Yes.
But people were talking about it,
and there was a lot of beware.

Cluster 85
	All right, a round of applause
for Josh, if we could.
It's raining men, hallelujah!
It's raining men, amen!
It's raining men, hallelujah!
Get ready, all you lonely girls.

	But along the way, as
you may know, there is this tradition within the class,
particularly in healthy times, of a number of events that really
brings people get together, not just collaboratively
and academically, but to just solve problems and generally
engage with each other as well.
A gift from my mother
the day I was born.
They hand you back, so to
speak, a value that you can do anything that you want with.
With those same building
blocks and several others, can you make exactly the sorts of things
that Andrew brought to life as well.
It's just so incredibly
gratifying but also empowering.

	So notice, it grows to fill.
So they actually look
like a mole, in this case.
And this is the correct shape
even though it's too small, but Scratch will
accommodate that for us.
I think your hypothesis was right,
just looks kind of stupid, right?
Here's my x-axis, size
of problem on the x-axis.

	Nothing bad happens if
I try to go through it.
It doesn't do anything.
Now nothing's happened yet
because it's a conditional, right?
A side effect is usually
something visual that happens, like as a side effect of
you calling a function.
No big deal.

	[VIDEO PLAYBACK] [MUSIC - THE WEATHER GIRLS, "IT'S
 RAINING MEN"] [MUSIC PLAYING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] - (SINGING) Hi.
Now, this particular
program, "Raining Men," was written by a former CS50
teaching fellow, Andrew Berry, who's actually now the general
manager of the Cleveland Browns, the American football team.
'Cause tonight, for the first
time, just about half-past 10:00-- half-past 10:00-- for the
first time in history, it's going to start raining
men-- start raining men!
MC HAMMER: (SINGING) As such.
We're your Weather Girls,
and have we got news for you.

	And it's an evening, a 12-hour
opportunity to collaborate with classmates on your very own final
project, in a large space on campus, that ends-- if you're awake with us-- at 5:00 AM.
We'll get together generally
around 7:00 PM in the evening, wrap up around 7:00
AM, if you so choose.
And if it does take time, and if
you do feel those frustrations, but you simultaneously eventually
feel that sense of accomplishment, that just means it's all working.
Of course-- of course, this is
6:00, 7:00 AM at that point, but it's an opportunity
finally to lead into what's called the CS50 fair, which is an end
of semester celebration, an exhibition, of everything that you'll
accomplish over the coming months.
We can hop on some CS50 shuttles and go
down the road for some pancakes at IHOP around 6:00.
