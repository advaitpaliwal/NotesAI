Cluster 1
	Lamarck
Lamarck’s Theory of Evolution
Tendency toward  Perfection(Giraffe necks)

Use and Disuse (bird’s using forearms)

Inheritance of Acquired Traits
Population Growth
Thomas Malthus-19th century English economist
If population grew (more Babies born than die)
Insufficient living space
Food runs out
Darwin applied this theory to animals
Publication of Orgin of Species
Russel Wallace wrote an essay summarizing evolutionary change from his field work in Malaysia

Gave Darwin the drive to publish his findings
Natural Selection & Artificial Selection
Natural variation--differences among individuals of a species

Artificial selection- nature provides the variation among different organisms, and humans select those variations they find useful.
Living Organisms and Fossils

Darwin collected the preserved remains of ancient organisms, called fossils.
EVOLUTION

Charles Darwin


Darwin’s Theory of Evolution
Evolution, or change over time, is the process by which modern organisms have descended from ancient organisms.
Species alive today descended with modification from species that lived in the past

All organisms on earth are united into a single family tree of life by common descent
Evolution by Natural Selection
The Struggle for Existence-members of each species have to compete for food, shelter, other life necessities

Survival of the Fittest-Some individuals better suited for the environment

Natural Selection
Over time, natural selection results in changes in inherited characteristics of a population.
How do you think Darwin came up with his theory?
As Darwin studied fossils, new questions arose.

Cluster 2
	The Galapagos Island

Darwin was fascinated in particular by the land tortoises and marine iguanas in the Galápagos.
Fossils
The Galapagos Island
The smallest, lowest islands were hot, dry, and nearly barren-Hood Island-sparse vegetation

The higher islands had greater rainfall and a different assortment of plants and animals-Isabela- Island had rich vegetation.
Giant tortoises varied in predictable ways from one island to another.
Findings:  evidence to propose a revolutionary hypothesis about how life changes over time
Patterns of Diversity

Darwin  visited Argentina and Australia which had similar grassland ecosystems.

Cluster 3
	Animals found in the Galapagos
Land Tortoises

Darwin Finches

Blue-Footed Booby

Marine Iguanas


Animals
The Journey Home
Darwin Observed that characteristics of many plants and animals vary greatly among the islands

Hypothesis:  Separate species may have arose from an original ancestor

Ideas that shaped Darwin’s Thinking
James Hutton: 
1795 Theory of Geological change
Forces change earth’s surface shape
Changes are slow
Earth much older than thousands of years

Ideas that Shaped Darwin’s Thinking
Charles Lyell
 Book: Principles of Geography
Geographical features can be built up or torn down
Darwin thought if earth changed over time, what about life?
Some of those fossils resembled organisms that were still alive today.
Patterns of Diversity


Darwin posed challenging questions.

Cluster 4
	neither Argentina nor Australia was home to the sorts of animals that lived in European grasslands.
Why were there no rabbits in Australia, despite the presence of habitats that seemed perfect for them?
those grasslands were inhabited by very different animals.
