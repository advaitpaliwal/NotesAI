hi everybody it's me waddles diamonds are your best friend or you want them to be no matter what your current situation is if you like diamonds this is the video for you with the 1.19 update diamond mining has changed again in this video we're going to take a look at diamond mining and talk about some of the best ways to do it before we get too busy make a quick stop at the like button and if you're new here hi welcome if you'd like to become genius then subscribing it's a great idea everybody knows what a diamond is so fortunately we can skip that check out this chart right here this is the current or generation chart as of minecraft 1.19 this chart is our first big guide when it comes to mining diamonds efficiently broken down into words and simple words of that diamond generation how does it work well the diamonds generate in multiple batches both on java and betarock edition diamonds are going to get more common the deeper you go in your world when you take a look at bedrock and java edition side by side there are actually some minor differences between diamond generation one difference that doesn't exist is the fact that most diamonds or many of them at least are going to generate with no air exposure meaning you're gonna have to dig to find them you know how copper ore generates more commonly inside the drips on caves bomb well diamonds aren't like that they have no connection to biome at all diamond ore generates at world generation when diamond ore generates it can actually replace a couple blocks in the game diamond ore will replace stone deepside granite andesite diorite and tough if it's in the way unless you're on bedrock edition on bedrock tough can't be replaced by diamond ore so that's great but what does it all mean for us well it means that our journey today begins down at y14 diamond generation begins at y14 and gets more common the deeper you go just in case you don't over something you'll need at least an iron pickaxe to mine diamonds so diamonds get more common the deeper you go as you move past the stone range diamond ore will turn into deep slate diamond door now there is no difference at all between these two blocks except for the texture as you go deeper and deeper and deeper eventually you're gonna hit bedrock bedrock starts to generate at y59 or when you're standing on y59 that's something that you're going to want to keep in mind especially when you're branch mining for diamonds so there's our quick intro a little bit of explanation now let's talk the methods we're going to talk about five different methods in today's video we won't be ranking the methods in today's video because they're all pretty good depending on the farms and things that you have in your world some methods might be easier than the other methods the first method the most basic is plain old caving haha yes shocking indeed believe it or not one of the best ways to find diamonds is to well uh well to look for diamonds ever since the revamp of the caves in 1.18 this method is actually kind of enjoyable at least in my opinion so for method number one you're going to want to look at grabbing supplies like this right here basically this is just your basic mining supplies you're going to want to have whatever supplies you like to have usually when you're mining now if you're going the caving route for diamonds my biggest tip for you is find a big cave finding a big cave like the one that we're in right now is going to make your life a whole lot easier see it's pretty straightforward if you think about it a little bit big cave has more blocks exposed to air unfortunately not every diamond generates exposed air but if you can expose more blocks to air then the likelihood of finding diamond ore definitely increases to make your life easier when playing old caving looking for diamonds try and find a cave that is really big and open in a cave that is really big and open and also deep this cave is at negative 49 that's insanely deep remember the deeper you go the more diamonds will generate if your cave is big open and really deep it's almost guaranteed 100 for sure there'll be at least a little bit of diamonds inside of the cape while you're down inside of these deep caves looking for diamonds if you come across a patch of gravel it's a brilliant idea to mine this patch of gravel up a lot of the diamonds that generate in your world will generate fully blocked in with a couple torches and a shovel removing gravel is insanely easy just like all the other methods in this video digging out gravel is not a surefire way to find diamonds but it definitely is a lot easier than mining out sacks and stacks of deep slave for hours find the big deep cave mine out the gravel my third tip for you when it comes to mining for diamonds the plain old fashioned way is the f3 trick if you're on java edition and you find lava deep in a cave hit f3 and look around at the lava check out this chunk of information right here that chunk of information is telling me exactly what i'm looking at okay so this is actually kind of crazy check this out over here we have tough but then over here actually diamond ore which is absolutely amazing that's telling me that there is diamond ore right below this lava if i go ahead and remove the lava maybe place some blocks and block it in dig these blocks out there show to be yup there definitely is diamonds right there down below the lava that's not too bad if you enjoy exploring your world the good old-fashioned way maybe taking things a little bit more slowly this is a great method for you i highly recommend finding your first diamonds in your world with this method it's the easiest and cheapest the next method on our menu today gets a little bit more expensive but is way way more safer branch mining diamonds generate most commonly deep why waste time mining not deep when you could just mine deep and maybe if you're lucky right away find diamonds the deeper you go the more diamonds you should find right well yes but also actually no remember the blocks that i talked about the diamond canvas place well bedrock wasn't one of them diamond ore is not going to replace bedrock ever so if you're going to branch mine skip the bedrock layer that means to find the most diamonds possible you need to mine in a layer where there is not bedrock the layer where there is not bedrock that's going to be standing on y negative 59 looking at negative 58 that is the best layer in the entire world to mind diamonds in minecraft 1.19 branch mining so if you're going to set up a branch mine first things first go down to y negative 59. like make sure you're standing on y negative 59. this is going to be the layer right above bedrock if you're standing on this layer you will hit zero bedrock the other than in the floor but that's not a problem when it comes to a branch mine really you have so many options i mean you could make like a big wide main tunnel and then branch off with that thing or you could dig down and just really essentially start making small branches i like to personally make my branch mines a little bit nicer so typically where i start is down at negative 59 make a three by three hallway nice thing about this while you're digging out the hallway if you're lucky you might be able to actually find some diamonds right off the bat which is cool always always always whenever you find diamond ore dig around the diamond ore diamond ore generates some blotches sometimes these blotches are a little bit disconnected as you can see there that's the second piece of diamond that's amazing looked easy there but don't get your hopes up that was luck strip mining branch mining whatever you want to call it this gonna take some time to execute this method most efficiently i recommend grabbing a couple different things thing number one torches you're going to want to light up your mind some mobs don't spawn this will make it a little bit safer thing number two food you're going to be down here doing a lot of work digging that's going to eat up your hunger you're going to need to eat every once in a while a good pickaxe branch money can take a little bit of time running around inside of a cave is way less expensive especially when it comes to pickaxes enchantments are technically totally your call i recommend having a pickaxe that looks something like this unbreaking three is very very important if you want to make this pickaxe last forever mending and silk touch having silk touch will keep your inventory clear alternatively instead of soap touch you could go with shulker boxes under chest just extra chest something like that so your branch mine it begins the negative 59 then hallways you're gonna need to make hallways branching off of this thing the hallways should still be on negative 59. they could be two blocks tall if you'd like maybe three blocks tall if you'd like to totally your call now the hallways space them out at least three blocks but you could honestly probably go something more like five blocks it's all totally up to you and how much patience you have patience is maybe the most important supply for this method because this can take a long time now fortunately you're gonna get a ton of deep sleep maybe you could build with a deep site all there really is to this method is go down deep and make hallways make the hallways too tall three tall whatever you like and spread the hallways out two blocks three blocks buy blocks really again whatever you'd like it's totally up to you one other tip that i do have for you when branch mining is if you need to conserve torches because you know no coal down here most hostile mobs need a light level of zero to spawn complete darkness and now it is is pretty easy to achieve place a torch go 30 or so blocks place another one and your light will never touch zero if you'd like me to make a video that goes a little bit more in depth when it comes to branch mining for diamonds let me know down below let's move on this next method is basically back to the basics except this time we spice it up a little bit with potions specifically night vision night vision mining this method is actually pretty similar to the first method that we talked about this method will find us back down inside of the biggest deepest caves in our world but before we do that we need supplies at the point of the game where you're brewing up a ton of potions you're probably gonna have a better pickaxe so that's cool and then your other basic mining supplies so torches armor you know that stuff i highly highly recommend pulling off this method with potions of night vision that lasts for eight minutes now to brew those things you're going to need these materials right here we start with blaze powder and netherwort and water bottles inside the brewing stand that'll give us awkward potion combine that with a golden carrot that'll give us night vision for three minutes combine that with the redstone dust and then we end up with three night vision potions for eight minutes that's perfect first things first locate a big cave that is deep you know where diamonds are most common and exposed after you've located that big cave it's night vision potion time now when you brew your night vision potions you're going through three of them which means 24 solid minutes of mining drink the night vision potion look around and look at how obvious diamonds are with night vision potion you can easily run through this cave look around at the ceiling the floor everything and find every single diamond like really really quickly a little bonus for this one too it's going to make all of the ores out of this deep dark cave really really obvious like check that out gold that's it that's literally all there is to this method drink the night vision potion run around look at the ceiling specifically usually yes you see you see usually you would miss the ceiling it's so tall and dark yep that's never gonna happen now that's it drink the night vision run around look at the cave now i do recommend bringing some torches with you for this method even though you don't need the torches to see anymore torches will definitely cut out the spawn so that's gonna help and that's it that's literally it that's all there is to this method drink the night vision run around inside of the cave locate the diamonds also maybe locate other cave entrances that you might have otherwise missed and profit profit profit that's all there is to it this is where things start to get a little bit more different this next method is a little bit more abstract when it comes to mining for diamonds but if you've never tried this in survival before you need to try moss mining supplies for this method of course as always we start with the basic mining supplies you know good armor pickaxe things like that this time around though add moss blocks bone meal and some kind of good hoe to your sedum here's my hole with efficiency five division z5 technically not necessary but is gonna make things way way faster step one get supplies step two find a big deep cape you know something like this cape right here that's pretty good the step three place moss down step four bone meal the moss step five keep bone mealing the moss all over the place spread the stuff around it's gonna take a little bit of time but trust me trust me it'll be worth it it can get a little bit annoying because you actually can't bone meal certain moss blocks like ones with the azalea on it so you're gonna have to break some of those things maybe have extra inventory space for those and remember torches every once in a while don't want mobs wants to happen but be careful if you place a torch on the ground on like a deep side block then that actually can't turn into moss so maybe torches on like the wall or something anyways go down to the cave bonemeal significant amount of space and then it's ho time grab the hoe and start insta mining the hoe is going to mine on all of the moss blocks instantly if it has efficiency 5 diamond and maybe if you're lucky diamonds but also keeping it real here unfortunately sometimes you will not find any diamonds you'll end up with a big area that you dug out with tons of moss blocks all over the place this method plays off of the fact that sometimes diamonds generate not exposed to air an easy way to expose a lot of blocks to air very very quickly that worked exposed to air initially is moss all you need to do is grow the moss use the hoe and look at that dig out the blocks diamond or every once in a while this is a really cool unique way of mining block sound then it's also pretty efficient too i mean compared to how slow deep slide actually mines like look at that that's really really slow moss i mean it's not even close it's way faster now the deeper you go with this method as always today the more diamonds you should find but thankfully you can do this technically anywhere let's say i don't know you're having a lot of trouble finding a cave that actually goes really really deep you're just not sure how to get there well you could actually do this in the stone range too stone will actually convert over into moss as well if the moss is close enough to it the only downside to this method compared to the other methods is the high up front cost you're gonna need a lot of bone meal to pull this off that means maybe skeleton farm first and then the hoe it's gonna take a lot of damage you might want to either demanding on your hoe too or just have like a lot of hoes that you don't care about mining for diamonds in the deep caves with moss it's so cool it's so different and you've gotta try it let's move on to the honorable mention nowadays there are legitimately so many different methods for mining diamonds that i could do an entire second video on mining for diamonds if it wanted to one of the great ways to mine for diamonds is dive money dive mining is a little bit more dangerous though if you're not geared up the whole air exposure component of war generation is completely ignored when water is involved i mean it's pretty straight forward water it's not air and if a block generates next to water it's not open to air wake up a brand to do diamond mining method just dropped or dropped like a month ago with 1.19 deep dark mining this one again it starts with basic mining supplies jumps over to a hoe maybe a really really good home some wool blocks and the deep dark biome if you're on the surface stuck looking for the deep dark biome a great spot to start is below mountains if you're stuck and really can't find it i go into it a little bit more in this video right here check it out after this one how to find everything in 1.19 okay look right off the bat diamonds right down here inside of this cave it's luck it's a great sign so first things first find the deep dark biome second find a big cave again common theme here now that i found this big deep dark cave i'm going to want to look around and watch out for shriekers shriekers are a big problem with this method find a big deep dark biome locate the shriekers then it's a great idea to move over to those shriekers and take them out when you're trying to take these things out consider a hoe they mine faster if you find yourself in a little bit more of a difficult situation kind of like this right here as you can see a shrieker right there and sensors right there that's a big problem wool blocks place wool blocks down strategically to cut out vibrations that or just mine the streaker right away that'll work too once you've made sure that an area is clear of shriekers it's time to start modding the blocks so the blocks on the ground the skull clocks they mine so quickly with a hope get a good home maybe diamond division z5 and you can insta mine all of these blocks insta mining all these blocks is going to expose a ton of other blocks to air that weren't exposed before some of these blocks maybe if you're lucky are going to be diamonds if they're not diamonds on the bright side you're going to get an absurd amount of experience now if your hoe has mending you could do this literally all day long until this biome is completely gone unfortunately it's never going to be a 100 success thing it's completely up to world generation but this is so easy you don't even have to think while you're doing this you just run around and dig out the blocks definitely cannot stress this enough watch out for the shriekers inside of this biome very bad and if one goes off you actually have a quick second to run over to it and take it out watch out for the warden once you eliminate the streakers mining for diamonds inside the deep dark biome with a home is not only insanely easy but also pretty safe to skulk or not hostile mobs won't spawn inside of this biome there's nothing to complain about here aside from the warden the method is safe the method is insanely easy like you don't have to think about them you get diamonds and you get tons of experience too this is great the method is great and depending on how you run things maybe so touch on your home you'll end up with a bunch of blocks too diamond mining in some of the best ways possible then 1.19 i hope you enjoyed this video and i hope it helped you out if it did take a quick second and drop a like it's so simple and it helps me out huge time thank you so much for watching this video especially if you watch it all the way to this point right here you're the best if you know of another method that works pretty well i'd love to know drop that down below it's going to be waddles i'll see you tomorrow bye everyone [Music] you
